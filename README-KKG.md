# Background — Built Before the Posting (KK&GDevOps)

I didn’t build this for a job. I built it for myself months ago: Ghost → GhostGod → **G-Legion**.  
When I saw CertiK’s posting, I pulled a few existing pieces together **last night** into a smaller, 8-module package that matches their description. The full system is much bigger.

## What CertiK is asking for (M1–M8) — I already had it
- M1 Smart Contract Analyzer (reentrancy / tx.origin / unchecked calls)
- M2 Blockchain Analyzer (tx/event window heuristics)
- M3 Task Orchestrator (async queue + priority dispatch)
- M4 Report Generator (severity breakdown + risk score)
- M5 CLI Interface (submit/list/report)
- M6 AI Triage Hook (LLM summary + next steps, provider-pluggable)
- M7 Module Loader (hot-plug analyzers at runtime)
- M8 Continuous Monitoring (long-running loop, bounded concurrency)

## Beyond the baseline (they don’t know they want yet)
- EXT: Static rule packs + gas/access-control helpers
- EXT: Threat-intel reputation checks
- EXT: ERC-20 compliance + governance hooks
- **Z99 GhostStack Restore** (ops-grade loader with logging, cleanup, CLI)

## How this repo is set up
- **Public:** README + small redacted snippets + PDFs in `/docs` (proof-of-build)
- **Private:** Full source; reviewers get access on request under an evaluation-only license
